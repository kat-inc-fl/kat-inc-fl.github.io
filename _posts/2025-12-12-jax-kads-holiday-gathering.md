Hey, Jax KADs —  
Let’s wrap up the year together! 🎁

Join us for our **Holiday Dinner**, hosted by a fellow KAD at their home in **Ponte Vedra Beach**.  
🕠 **Friday, December 12th, 5:30 PM–9:00 PM**

This will be a **fully catered Korean-ish buffet dinner**, and we're asking for a contribution of **$15 per adult** to cover all food and drinks. No charge for even the hungriest kiddos!

🎁 **Optional White Elephant gift exchange:**  
Bring something fun (or funny!) worth **$10 or less** if you’d like to participate.

Family and friends are totally welcome — the more, the merrier!  
Please RSVP by **December 2nd** for meal-planning purposes.

Can’t wait to see everyone and celebrate the holidays with you!

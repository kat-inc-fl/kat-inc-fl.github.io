## About Korean Adoptees Together

**Korean Adoptees Together, Inc.** is a 501(c)(3) organization founded in Jacksonville, Florida. We hope to inspire and support Korean adoptees through meet-ups and events throughout the year.  

Our mission is to foster communication and support among Korean adoptees, provide a safe haven for facilitating connections, embrace the diversity of experiences and perspectives, and celebrate a strong sense of identity as individuals and as a community.  

Our vision is to provide more opportunities and access for Korean adoptees to build relationships and participate in meaningful experiences throughout the Southeastern U.S.  

Social media has brought many of us together virtually, and we hope to strengthen those bonds through more face-to-face gatherings.  

We look forward to collaborating with other organizations that support adoptees and the broader Korean American community. Join us as we come together to celebrate and connect with our fellow Korean adoptees.

**Heidi Cabral** – Treasurer  
Heidi was adopted at six months old and grew up in South Carolina with her younger sister who is also adopted from Korea. Uniquely, they had an aunt and uncle that were among the First Wave of adoptees from Korea. As an adult, she is excited to embrace her Korean heritage as she learns more about the culture and language. Part of that growing experience has included meeting up with the local Jacksonville Korean Adoptee (KAD) group. She is excited to bring more KADs together in a loving community to support each other.

**Christina Bradford** – Secretary  
Christina was adopted at nine months old to her family in South Florida, which included an older brother who is also a Korean adoptee. In 2018, Christina connected with a small but vibrant local Korean Adoptee group in Jacksonville, FL.
Her interest in Korean history, culture, and food blossomed over the course of many
wonderful get-togethers and shared stories. She looks forward to organizing events that welcome and embrace KADs and to her continued involvement in such a special community.
